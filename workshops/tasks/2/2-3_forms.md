# 2.3 - Forms

## Description

Currently out details feature is pretty basic. We download the data and display it. In this task we'd like to make the details of our posting editable by introducing edit form.

## Goal

1. Create `EditForm` component which will work as a container for editing features.
2. Inside of newly created component create basic form which lets you edit posting details data. It can be implemented in both template-driven or reactive way.
3. Prepare function which lets you save form details. For workshop purposes you can only `console.log` form contents.
