# 2.4 - How to

1. Implement custom validator as a function returning `ValidatorFn`
2. When working with reactive forms, validator can be applied directly to specific `FormControl`
3. When working with template-driven forms, validator should be added to shared list of providers, see:
```
providers: [
    { provide: NG_VALIDATORS, useExisting: myCustomValidatorFnc, multi: true }
]
```
