2. Pass data from `PostingDetailsComponent` to two newly created components via `@Input()`
3. Extract existing template of `PostingDetailsComponent` and put it into `PostingDetailsPreviewComponent`.
4. Create template-driven / reactive form inside of `EditFormComponent` by using one of two options:
    * `FormsModule`, with `[(ngModel)]` directives applied to form elements
    * `ReactiveFormsModule`. with `FormGroup` and `FormControls`
